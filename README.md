Project Title - Pandas

Summary - This repository contains a data analytis project utilizing Pandas.

PyCitySchools - I was given two data files in csv format containing school and student performance data.  I was asked to provide two observeable trends based on the data.  Based on the observed trends it would appear that Student Performce can be expected to be higher at a smaller school with a lower per student budget.  In addition a Charter School would appear to outperform District Schools, but as Charter Schools appear to be smaller in Student population this may just be restating the first observation.

Following is an outline of the data summaries requested.
  ### District Summary

* Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### School Summary

* Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
